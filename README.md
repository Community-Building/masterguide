# Mission and goal

**Our goal is to build up the first full comprehensive end-to-end guide on the design, execution and on-going coordination of decentralized token network communities.**


## Crowdsourcing of knowledge

1. Create a shared, growing and evolving outline of all the key aspects of designing and coordinating decentralized communities.
2. Invite community members and the broader community to contribute.
3. Allow anyone to suggest contributions either as natively published content or externally published content.

## How contributions will be curated

We will look to hold a fairly high bar for content to be accepted into the guide.

In addition to the content itself, we will ONLY accept content from existing DAO contributors, coordnators, infra builders and those with real hands on experience. 


## Contributor guidelines

- Expect your work to be rejected by a reviewer.
- Just because it is rejected does not mean it is not valuable.
- Try your best.

## Governance

While the content of this project looks to be crowdsourced, and it will be a centrally governed and managed project by a few select individuals. If you believe this project to be mis-managed for any other purposes than to create the best aggregation of DAO learnings, we invite you to fork the project.

## Endgoal

- Eventually if ever the content becomes complete. 
- We'll look to publish the contents as a book.
- Funnel revenue into a community governed treasury (Gitcoin grants funding?).
